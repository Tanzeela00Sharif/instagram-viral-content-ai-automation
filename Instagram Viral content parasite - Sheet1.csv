They released PersonaPlex-7B, an open-source conversational model that can listen and speak at the same time.

It is free, MIT licensed, with open weights on Hugging Face.

Most voice systems still rely on a rigid ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline. One system listens, another thinks, another speaks. It works, but it never feels natural. Conversations turn into forced back-and-forth turns.

PersonaPlex-7B takes a different approach. The model can listen and speak at the same time.

Instead of passing control between components, it runs directly on continuous audio tokens using a dual-stream transformer. Text and audio are generated in parallel.

That enables things voice AI has struggled with for years. Instant back-channel responses. Natural interruptions. A real conversational rhythm that feels human.

Persona control is fully zero-shot, so you can steer behavior without fine-tuning.

A top executive at Kioxia says demand from AI is pushing memory prices up across the board. not just SSDs, but RAM as well. large data centers and AI systems are buying huge amounts of memory, leaving less supply for consumer PCs.

The company has already sold out its NAND production well into the future, and expects tight supply to continue for years. at the same time, RAM prices are rising as manufacturers prioritize AI and server workloads over laptops, gaming PCs, and upgrades.

The result is simple. storage and memory are no longer getting cheaper. and building or upgrading a PC is likely to cost more for a while.

RAM is a big part of this shift. Modern AI workloads need large amounts of memory, and high-end RAM is getting more expensive and less practical for consumer PCs. Cloud providers can pool massive amounts of memory and processing power and let users access it on demand.

A top executive at Kioxia says demand from AI is pushing memory prices up across the board. not just SSDs, but RAM as well. large data centers and AI systems are buying huge amounts of memory, leaving less supply for consumer PCs.

The company has already sold out its NAND production well into the future, and expects tight supply to continue for years. at the same time, RAM prices are rising as manufacturers prioritize AI and server workloads over laptops, gaming PCs, and upgrades.

The result is simple. storage and memory are no longer getting cheaper. and building or upgrading a PC is likely to cost more for a while.

https://www.instagram.com/p/DTz1ge7jdB6/,"🖥️☁️ Jeff Bezos says owning powerful PCs may not last forever as AI pushes hardware demands higher and memory becomes harder to scale locally.

He compares today’s computers to factories that once had to generate their own electricity. When power grids arrived, that model disappeared. Bezos thinks computing could follow the same path, with people renting compute power from the cloud instead of buying expensive machines.

RAM is a big part of this shift. Modern AI workloads need large amounts of memory, and high-end RAM is getting more expensive and less practical for consumer PCs. Cloud providers can pool massive amounts of memory and processing power and let users access it on demand.

This model is already visible in cloud gaming and remote desktops, where your device is mostly a terminal and the heavy lifting happens in a data center.

PCs are not going away anytime soon. But rising AI and memory requirements make cloud-based computing a more realistic default over time.

They released PersonaPlex-7B, an open-source conversational model that can listen and speak at the same time.

It is free, MIT licensed, with open weights on Hugging Face.

Most voice systems still rely on a rigid ASR → LLM → TTS pipeline. One system listens, another thinks, another speaks. It works, but it never feels natural. Conversations turn into forced back-and-forth turns.

PersonaPlex-7B takes a different approach. The model can listen and speak at the same time.

Instead of passing control between components, it runs directly on continuous audio tokens using a dual-stream transformer. Text and audio are generated in parallel.

That enables things voice AI has struggled with for years. Instant back-channel responses. Natural interruptions. A real conversational rhythm that feels human.

Persona control is fully zero-shot, so you can steer behavior without fine-tuning.

Elon Musk just made a bold claim about the future of surgery. He says Tesla’s Optimus robots will outperform human surgeons within the next three years.

In a recent 2026 interview, he argued that rapid gains in AI, computing power, and robotic precision are moving faster than most people expect. His view is that surgery is a field where consistency matters, and machines do not get tired, distracted, or limited by years of training.

Musk also pointed to a global shortage of doctors and surgeons. Training takes a long time, and mistakes are part of human work. Robots, he says, could learn continuously, update instantly, and operate at scale.

From DeepMind's documentary, the most replayed scene shows a meeting where someone tells CEO Demis Hassabis that AlphaFold can predict all known protein sequences, around 1 to 2 billion, in about a month. 

He looks up from his phone and says, “Why don’t we just do that? That’s a great idea. We should run every protein in existence and release it.”

That decision would later lead to a Nobel Prize.

AlphaFold was the result of years of work at Google DeepMind, solving a biology problem scientists had struggled with for nearly 50 years. Predicting how proteins fold from their amino acid sequence was slow, expensive, and usually required lab experiments. AlphaFold showed this could be done with AI, accurately, at scale, and in days instead of years.

DeepMind then released AlphaFold for free, allowing researchers worldwide to study proteins at a scale never possible before, speeding up progress in medicine, biology, and drug discovery.

They released ""Learn Your Way"", an AI tool that turns any PDF or textbook into personalized learning formats.

The problem with textbooks? They're one-size-fits-all nightmares. Google's solution is brilliant: AI reads your interests (sports, music, food) and your grade level, then rewrites every example to match what you actually care about. 

Instead of static pages, lessons adapt to your grade level and interests in real time. Content can be explored as interactive text, audio lessons, narrated slides, mind maps, or quizzes.

Google tested this with 60 Chicago students, ages 15-18. Randomized controlled trial. 40 minutes to learn about brain development.

Results were brutal:

- Learn Your Way: 78% retention after 3-5 days
- Traditional PDF: 67% retention
- 100% felt more comfortable vs 70% with PDFs
